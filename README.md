I added scrolling text and changed the code so the morphing of all digits animate on the same time. There's also a web interface where you can change the scrolling text and the color of the edge and scrolling text. Change color the digits is not yet working.
Scrolling text can have [DDD], [DDDD], [MMM], [MMMM] and [DATUM]. All date strings are in Dutch.
